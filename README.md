<h2>ðŸŒŒ Legends of the Aetherfall â€” A Java OOP RPG Game</h2>

<p><strong>Legends of the Aetherfall</strong> is a console-based, turn-based RPG game built in Java using core object-oriented programming principles. Step into a mythical world where brave heroes battle dark forces for the fate of the realm.</p>

<p>You play as one of three hero classes â€” <strong>Mage</strong>, <strong>Archer</strong>, or <strong>Warrior</strong> â€” each with unique abilities and power levels. Face off against formidable enemies like the <strong>Dark Overlord</strong>, the <strong>Regional Warlord</strong>, and the cursed <strong>Corrupted Mortal</strong>, each with their own special attacks and status effects.</p>

<h3>ðŸ§© Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Turn-based combat system</li>
  <li>Encapsulated character stats (health, power, etc.)</li>
  <li>Class-specific special moves</li>
  <li>Status effects like <em>freezing</em>, <em>shielding</em>, and <em>attack weakening</em></li>
  <li>Clean, object-oriented design with <strong>inheritance</strong>, <strong>abstraction</strong>, and <strong>polymorphism</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>ðŸŽ® How It Works:</h3>
<p>Choose your hero, choose your villain, and fight to survive. Use your strategic mind to decide whether to attack or unleash powerful special moves â€” all while managing your power level and dodging deadly enemy abilities.</p>
